# Unbind Trademark Policy

**The code is MIT. The brand is not.**

Unbind’s source code is forever free and open under the MIT License. Fork it, modify it, sell it — no restrictions.

Our marks — the word **“Unbind”**, the Unbind logo, and other brand assets — stay ours.

---

## ✅ You can, no permission needed

- Say “Built with/Powered by/Based on Unbind.”
- Write guides, blog posts, or reviews.

## ❌ You can’t

- Distribute a **modified** version that still uses the Unbind name or logo.
- Launch “Unbind Pro”, “Super Unbind”, or any confusingly similar product.
- Brand your company, site, or UI so it looks official.
- Suggest we endorse or maintain your fork.

**Bottom line:** Do anything you like with the software. Just don’t pass your fork off as the official Unbind.
